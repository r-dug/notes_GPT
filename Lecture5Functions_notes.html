    <h1>Lecture 5: Functions in C and C++</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to Functions</h2>
    <p>Functions are fundamental to breaking down complex projects into smaller, more manageable units of code. They allow for code reusability, information hiding, minimizing exposure to internals, and reducing bugs. This kind of top-down design approach leads to code that is easier to understand, debug, and maintain.</p>

    <h2>What is a Function?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>function</strong> is a named block of code, carrying out a specific task.</li>
        <li>A function should do one thing well. try to keep it simple.</li>
        <li>It has a set of parameters it expects to receive.</li>
        <li>It has a return type, which dictates the type of value it sends back to the caller.</li>
        <li>There are many libraries of useful functions. Consider checking to see if there is a public function that already does the thing you want to do instead of creating it from scratch.</li>
        <li>Functions sometimes do not need to intake arguments, or even return anything. That doesn't mean they aren't useful.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Using Functions</h2>
    <p>You have been using functions such as <code>printf</code>. Understanding how to <strong>invoke</strong> or <strong>call</strong> these functions is crucial.</p>
    <p>As programmers, we can create <strong>customized functions</strong> for our specific needs. The process involves defining a <strong>function prototype</strong> and later providing the <strong>function definition</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Function Prototype</h2>
    <p>This is the declaration of a function before use. Provide information about the "public interface".</p>
    <p>A function prototype informs the compiler about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The function's name.</li>
        <li>The number and type of parameters.</li>
        <li>The return type of the function.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Function Definition</h2>
    <p>Writing the code that the function actually does... You CAN do this without prototyping. The professor suggests using it though as a best practice.</p>
    <p>When defining a function, in addition to the return type and name, you provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A set of parameter names and their types.</li>
        <li>The body of the function, where the actual computations or operations are performed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Function Call</h2>
    <p>A function call is where you invoke the function and pass any required arguments. The function performs its operation and returns a result, if applicable.</p>

    <h2>Information Hiding and Scope</h2>
    <p>Information hiding is a principle that ensures only the necessary details of a function's operation are visible to its caller, providing a clear public interface to the function. This is where a function's <strong>scope</strong> comes in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A variable's <strong>scope</strong> indicates where the variable is accessible within the code.</li>
        <li>Remember that information hiding is like the public display of the funtion. think about printf(). As far as you are concerned as a public user of the function, it is a 'black box'.</li>
        <li>Variables declared within a function are local to that function and are not accessible outside it.</li>
        <li>Global variables, on the other hand, are accessible throughout the entirety of the code.</li>
        <li>Local variables only exist while the code it is in scope of is executing.</li>
        <li>Note: you can kinda hide a global variable by declaration of a local variable of the same name of the global variable.</li>
        <li>Professor uses president's name as an example. Pretty funny.</li>
        <li>Local variables are preferable. The information the variable represents is hidden, and this encapsulation sort of "protects" that information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Parameter Passing</h2>
    <p>There are two main ways to pass arguments to functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pass by value:</strong> A copy of the argument's value is passed to the function. Changes to the argument within the function do not affect the original variable.</li>
        <li><strong>Pass by reference:</strong> The actual variable's address is passed to the function (using '&variable' vs 'variable'), allowing changes within the function to affect the original variable. Therefore, you don't really need to return anything; your function manipulates the value at the address you pass in as an argument.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Storage Classes</h2>
    <p>Variables can be categorized based on their storage duration and scope:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>auto:</strong> The default storage class for local variables.</li>
        <li><strong>static:</strong> For retaining variable values even after the function ends. They can be local or global.</li>
        <li><strong>register:</strong> Hints to the compiler to store the variable in a register for fast access. Very fast but 'expensive'. Modern compilers will probably do a better job of memory allocation than 'you'. Know what it is, but don't worry about how to use it.</li>
        <li><strong>extern:</strong> Explicitly declares a global variable that can be accessed across multiple files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <p>Use local variables over global variables whenever possible.</p>
