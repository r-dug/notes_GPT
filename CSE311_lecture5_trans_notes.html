    <h3>What is Ethics?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Study of morality and principles guiding right and wrong behavior.</li>
        <li>Not necessarily equivalent to law or personal beliefs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Major Categories of Ethics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Metaethics:</strong> Fundamental questions of morality (not the focus of this class).</li>
        <li><strong>Normative Ethics:</strong> Practical guides to make ethical decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Applied Ethics:</strong> Application of ethical theories to specific fields, e.g., medical ethics, legal ethics, computer ethics (ACM Code).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Three Major Frameworks of Ethics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Virtue Ethics:</strong> Emphasizes adopting an ethical character. Examples include classical Greek and Roman ethics, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, and various religious and cultural ethical systems.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Deontological Ethics:</strong> Duty or rule-based ethical theories. Examples are legal systems, professional codes of ethics, and Immanuel Kant's categorical imperatives.
            <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/">Read More</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Consequentialist Ethics:</strong> Ethical decisions based on the outcomes, aiming to maximize benefits and minimize harm. Utilitarianism by Bentham and Mill are key examples in this framework.
            <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/">Read More</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Applied Ethics - ACM Code of Ethics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Code consists of four sections and is not very long but critical for understanding professional ethical decisions in computing.</li>
        <li>Reading the ACM Code of Ethics is imperative for the ethics test.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong>
            <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics</a>
